# thesis-Information-News-exposure-issue-salience

As we all know, the technology and the way we communicate have evolved tremendously in recent decades. We have a whole range of digital devices that allow us to consult the media and access a wealth of information. However, the way we see and consume this information differs from an individual to another based on different aspects (age, gender, occupation, location and most importantly preferences). 

In this project, we focus in particular on news articles and how people consume them with respect to their preferences. Do people really stick to their preferences and read articles that are closely related to the socio-political issues they claim to be most important to them ? 

This leads to the main research question of this project : “How is the issue that a person considers most important related to what they browse?”

At the end of this project, we will provide a detailed explanation of the method used for identifying topics. In addition, we will share usable notebooks with our scripts and our approach on creating browsing profiles. 
We might go further and analyse the findings in correlation with other aspects such as age or gender.
